>If you were to start your Android position today, what would be your goals a year from now?

My goals would be to finish the current project before deadlines and gain as much knowledge, experience and recognition so as to 
achieve a higher position in the team as well as the organization.

Short term goals would be to get used to the environment asap and focus on the work in hand. Long term goals would be to take the organization to a respectable level and would like to work on projects related to location services, Android wear etc.
